# Space Harvest

Destroy asteroids, aliens, and other players while harvesting valuable minerals to keep your base alive.

## Gameplay

Destroy the asteroids to release minerals that you can then capture for energy by flying through them with your ship. Your base will also capture any minerals that float into it.

Destroy aliens to release rare super powered minerals.

Asteroids, aliens, and other players can destroy your ship and damage your base. If you run out of ships or your base runs out of energy, its game over.

Every 20,000 points your base will recharge and create you another ship.

## Controls

Player 1 can use the keyboard or the 1st joystick. Most controllers _should_ work but I've only tested with XBox 360 controllers.

On the 360 controller, the trigger buttons control trust and any other button shoots. Use the analog stick to rotate.

On the keyboard, spacebar fires, and the cursor keys control thrust and shooting.

To get in the game, click a button on any joystick or press spacebar to use the keyboard for player 1.

## AI Players

Press '1' or '2' to add in an AI player as player 1 or 2. Add them both in and watch them go at it for fun.

## What's coming next?

Upgrades - Use some of your collected minerals to upgrade your ship and base. More firepower, bigger collection range, etc.

Different game modes will allow you to set how you will compete.

A solo mode will allow you to compete against the clock or to reach a certain score perhaps.
