# Space Harvest

Destroy asteroids, aliens, and other players while harvesting valuable minerals to keep your base alive.

## Gameplay

Destroy the asteroids to release minerals that you can then capture for energy by flying through them with your ship. Your base will also capture any minerals that float into it.

Destroy aliens to release rare super powered minerals.

Asteroids, aliens, and other players can destroy your ship and damage your base. If you run out of ships or your base runs out of energy, its game over.

Every 20,000 points your base will recharge, create you another ship, and possibly give your base a bonus. Current bonuses include defensive turrets and auto-piloted mini-harvesters and collect minerals for you.

## Controls

Player 1 can use the keyboard or the 1st joystick. Most controllers _should_ work but I've only tested with XBox 360 controllers.

On the 360 controller, the trigger buttons control trust and any other button shoots. Use the analog stick to rotate.

On the keyboard, spacebar fires, and the cursor keys control thrust and shooting.

To get in the game, click a button on any joystick or press spacebar to use the keyboard for player 1.

## AI Players

Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the keyboard to add in an AI player in that slot. Add multiple for a challenge or to watch them go at it for fun.
